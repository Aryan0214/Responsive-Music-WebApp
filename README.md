## Music Player web Application
It's a project in which I made the music player with html and css and on one side added the menu and on another I made a list of trending songs. I used JavaScript in making the hamburger menu.

## Things I learnt
I learnt how to use multiple classes at once in CSS. I also learnt how to used nested flexbox while maintaing the grid layout as I divided the web page in three different parts.
This helped me in improving my CSS skills much more than before. And it was a sort of Mini-Project so it did not take me much time to build this.
Overall it was fun building this project.
